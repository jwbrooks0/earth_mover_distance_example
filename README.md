Example of the [earth mover distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance) algorithm

Below, I perform an example one-dimensional EMD analysis on two Gaussian distributions.  The first is centered at x=0, and the second is slowly shifted from x=-1 to x=1.   The minimum in the EMD occurs when the two overlap.
